Project Name: 
Customer Risk Assesment

Author: Karlo Sabay, 6/22/17

Project Content:
The solution contains two projects, the web application and the unit test project

Instruction:
You should be able to view the website by running it in Visual Studio

Other Details:
I focus more on how to address the testing issue.
I created a manager class (RiskAssesmentMaager) and put there all the "business rules" so that it will be easier to test.
I also created an interface for the manager class but for simplicity, i opt to not interface the methods to not make it more complicated.
